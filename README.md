# Sybil Activity Report

This repository contains our report hosted on [—Åommonwealth.im](https://commonwealth.im/layerzero/discussion/18720-report-1) at May 28th 2024 4:46 AM UTC, now duplicated to GitHub for better manageability and readability due to technical issues on the Commonwealth platform.      
We recommend that you follow this logic: first familiarize yourself with our methodology and reasoning, and then review all the files. They present clear and comprehensive evidence. If you wish, you may also refer to the dataset we have compiled, or verify everything on your side.
##

### Files Included
- [**all_addresses_clean.txt**](all_addresses_clean.txt): This file includes only a clean list of addresses.
- [**Reported Addresses**](reported_addresses.md): Addresses are clustered and grouped as described in the methodology, without table proofs. Notes like 'allcsvfull1' and 'huobi 10' are for internal navigation.
- [**Description Tables.md**](description_tables_all_in_one.md): Contains all tables demonstrating data indicative of Sybil activity within each cluster.
- [**Description Tables part1.md** to **part17.md**](description_tables): These files split the content of 'Description Tables (All in one).md' for easier access and navigation.
  
### Description
[description.md](description.md)  

### Methodology
[methodology.docx](methodology.md)  

#### All the tables in .xlsx
[description_table.xlsx](description_table.xlsx)

We stick to the classy style in the design of developers' documentation and used .md format, but for your convenience, we also want to attach a table where you can conveniently view information about all the wallets (with gradients and other visual tools). Use CTRL+F to search for the address you are interested in

## Additional Notes

- This GitHub version replicates the original report on Commonwealth.im without any modifications to the content, offering a stable and navigable format for reviewing our detailed findings.
- Our reports are extensive, and we cannot verify if the data was reported by others before us. We experienced a fast-paced first-come, first-served process during the second report window. Hence, if there are overlaps with previously reported data, we acknowledge no claim over others' intellectual property and any rewards associated with these addresses.
