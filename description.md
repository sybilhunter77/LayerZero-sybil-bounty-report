# Description
As we said in the methodology, we used a multi-model system to identify common Sybli behavior patterns 

Now, based on the specifics of the protocol activity, we have proposed the following set of criteria:
- Max volume per day (max_volume_per_day)
- Max amount of single tx (min_single_tx_amount)
- Date of max volume per day (day_of_max_volume)
- First transaction for the $STG token (first_$STG_tx)
- Total amount of txs (tx_count)
- First interaction with L0 smart-contract (L0_fist_tx_date)
- Last interaction with L0 smart-contract (L0_last_tx_date)
- Total volume of bridged funds (total_volume)
- Amount of source chains (source_chain_count) 
- Amount of destination chains (destination_chain_count) 
- Amount of interactions with L0 smart-contracts (L0_contracts_interacted_count)  
- First transaction in TOP-7 EVM Blockchains (top_evm_first_tx)
- Interaction with centralized exchanges (CEX)
- Common smart-contracts of the protocols (well-known protocols shows first)

For each specific group we used a different selection of criteria, but we can clearly say that we used at least 4 criteria, 3 of which should be heterogeneous (e.g. we did not rely only on 3 dates or only on volume equality). Moreover, each of the groups was processed carefully manually. Then we decided that verbal descriptions would not be as clear and we present tables. Everything is clear in them without words. We also strongly recommend you to read our Methodology
